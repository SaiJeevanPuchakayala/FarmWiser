## Smart Agriculture using Machine Learning and IoT

#### Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, still, it suffers from a heaping number of disasters such as climate change, unpredictable monsoon, or lack of it, droughts, floods, etc. Due to these, there is huge crop loss or failure. People involved in agriculture are the last to be taken care of, even when they are the one who feeds the whole country.

#### While with institutions failing to support agriculture in terms of providing loans and farmer welfare schemes, but now the time has come for technology to take over the change. So now the engineers are here with Data Science and IoT hand in hand for the rescue.


#### Data Science now allows farmers to improve their efficiency and reduce their environmental impact by predicting suitable crops, climate change, and the yield of the crop, which is based on the change in climate and the fertilizer being used.


#### Apart from these data science along with IoT is being used for forecasting and predicting weather conditions which helps farmers to irrigate their crops and use suitable fertilizer to improve soil fertility. The objective of the project is to develop a few data science models with all suitable machine learning algorithms by aiming for great accuracy in an optimistic way by correlating different factors that have influenced agriculture, this makes the project unique from the previous works in this domain.


## Relevance/Scope:
- Helps farmer’s to predict the diseases of the crop using Data Science techniques.
- Usage of weather prediction for automated irrigation system.
- Helps farmer’s to know the suitable crop to grow in that season.
- And development of an app or website for making the product accessible for the farmer which include prediction algorithms and few essential forecasting graphs.


## Flow of the project:
- Finding the Key Performance Indicators(KPI’s) from factors influencing agriculture and check
correlation between them.
- Integrate all the required sensors to a controller that senses all the essential values.
- Collecting the real time data of KPI’s using sensors (NPK(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and
Potassium) values, pH values etc.)
- Processing the data collected using the IoT devices using few optimistic data processing
techniques.
- Develop a robust machine learning model that takes the processed data as an Input and provides the desired output with great accuracy.
- Analysing the results using Graphs and preparing the real time Report.
